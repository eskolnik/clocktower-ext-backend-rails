            <li> Take a screenshot of your stream layout. The best way to do this is in your streaming software (OBS, Streamlabs, etc).
            If you screenshot a running twitch stream instead, be sure to capture only the 16:9 Twitch player, and not any of the
            black buffer area that Twitch adds. For best results, have your grimoire set up with five players for this screenshot.</li>
