# Clocktower Companion Backend
This is the backend of a Twitch extension for streamed games of Blood on the Clocktower.

This extension is designed to be used in conjunction with the unofficial [Townsquare](https://clocktower.online/) web app. 

# Endpoints

## JWT AUTH
These endpoints are called by the Twitch extension, and require a signed JWT to function.

### GET /grimoires/:channel_id
Loads the grimoire for a channelId based on JWT. Currently only capable of loading the broadcaster's view.

### GET /broadcasters/:channel_id
Get a broadcaster's secret key. Used for config view only
    
### POST /broadcasters
Update a broadcaster's secret key


## NO JWT AUTH
These endpoints are called by the bookmarklet on the Clocktower app, and only require the secret key.

### POST /grimoires
When a grimoire is received, we need to check the session,
see if anyone is currently streaming that session,
and publish updates to each of them.

### POST /sessions
Upsert a session record to assign a broadcaster to a specific session and player.
The `isActive` flag marks whether the session should be sent to the viewers (when false, overlay should show nothing).
